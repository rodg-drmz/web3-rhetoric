Building a Culture for G enerative AI Literacy 
 
in  Co llege  Language,  Literature,  and  Writing
Introductio n
This working paper asserts that educators should draw on our collective expert ise to shape how generative A I 
is used, bot h in our areas of professional responsibility and in society, given the signi˜cant impact these tools  
have on our civic, cultural, and economic activities (Gallagher, ﬁWritingﬂ and ﬁEthicsﬂ; Noble; Benjamin; Baron).
There is the risk in documents such as this, however, that through the very act of creating them we are 
foreclosing alternatives by acquiescing rather than resisting . After all, we did not ask for or create these 
tools, so why should we make a good faith eort to engage with them now? But the technology 
is
 here,  and  
while most educators were not its architects we believe it is in our collective professional interest to oer 
students, colleagues, and administ rators balanced and informed perspectives on the risks and harms as 
well  as  the  potential  bene˜ts.
As we conclude work on this document in the early summer of 2024, Ap ple has announced widesp read  
integration of generative A
 
I technologies into its platforms and devices, Google has moved aggressively to  
embed A I-generated content into its search results, and OpenA I has launched 
ChatGPT Edu
 to  partner  with  
colleges and universities by providing language model s that claim to be ˜ne-tuned to their institutional missions  
and needs. These developments suggest that A
 
I  technologies  are  mainstream  enough  to ect  education  
and literacy in numerous way s t hat have been addressed in our ˜rst two working papers. Nonetheless, many  
uncertainties remain around how AI will evolve and how we humans will integrate it into our lives.
The  term  
a rti˚cia l  intelligence
 may stimulate t he imagination with futuristic overtones, but its functioning is 
automated and algorithmic. Some key de˜nitions of the various types of A I follow:
Ł
 
Arti˚cia l  intelligence
 (A
 
I) refers to machine learning systems that make p redictions based on 
statistical models constructed from vast quantities of data.
Ł
 
Generative  AI  
(G
 
A
 
I)
, 
also predictive, refers to AI that produces synthetic text, images, or video in 
response to a user™s prompt.
Ł
 
Large langua ge  models  
(LLMs) are text-generation systems that use statistical calculations to p redict 
the likelihood that words or parts of words will appear successively. They are trained on human-
 
written text drawn from the Internet and other sources that have been digitized and p roduce a result 
based on a user™s prompt. LLMs involve various forms of human intervention behind the scenes, 
including human feedback and content moderation that inuence their performance.
Ł
 
Arti˚cia l  genera l  intel l igence
 (A
 
G
 
I) refers to a potential future kind of A
 
I  with  human-like  intellige n ce  
that would be able to teach itself to solve problems and perform new tasks without prior t raining . 
This kind of A
 
I does not yet exist.

G
 
A
 
I tools work quickly, drawing on immense amounts of data and comput ing power. It is import ant to 
unders tand that, while they ap pear to work like magic or to think like a human, they are data-driven and 
machine-enabled, t he product of theoretical and empirical work in advanced mathematics, statistic s, 
computer science, engineering, and linguistic s as well as the input of millions of everyday computer 
users. Without  t he  bene˜t  of  human  understanding,  G
 
A
 
I tools perform tasks that typically require human 
decision-making, such as analyzing natural language, recognizing patterns in data, and making predictions. 
L
 
L
 
Ms produce documents that are reasonable fac similes of human prose across a wide variety of subject 
areas, prose that is often ﬁgood enoughﬂ for typical everyday uses. The purported ﬁintelligenceﬂ attributed 
to  A
 
I lies in the ability to simulate cognitive functions that humans use. However, ﬁA
  
I ﬂ sy stems are not think
-
ers bu t statistical models that ﬁlearnﬂ by recognizing patterns in large bodies of training data. The systems 
become increasingly adept in producing outputs that draw from that training data, even as they also 
inevitably reproduce the biases or gaps in the original information. As a result, in many situations where G
 
A
 
I 
output looks and sounds p lausible at t he level of grammar and syntax, it is factually or demonstrably untrue.
Educators are now operating in an environment where the very term 
a rti˚cia l  intelligence
 ca n  create  
unrealistic expectations by implying the existence of an ent ity capable of independent logic and reasoning . 
However, it can quickly become apparent to users of G
 
A
 
I that its processes and output require t he supervi
-
sion and intervention of critically thinking humans.
Compounding the situation, G
 
A
 
I is no longer a s tand-alone technology in the sense of its being ﬁout thereﬂ 
(as a website or ap p) that individuals may choose either to use or not use. G
 
A
 
I is increasingly being embed
-
ded and integrated directly into everyday services, applicat ions, and devices, from Internet search to email 
and word processing . The technological landscape is already one in which there are no clear dividing lines 
between what is and isn™t a G
 
A
 
I tool or technology. Called for, urgently, is a focus on G
 
A
 
I  literacy.

The organizations that have cont ributed to the development of this working paper position G
˛
A
˛
I literacy as 
building on two goals, initially introduced by the New London Group in relation to multiliteracies: accessing 
ﬁevolving language [s]ﬂ across dierent contexts and developing critical frameworks that help imagine better 
ﬁsocial futuresﬂ (New London Group 60). Since G
 ˛
A
˛ 
I will aect nearly all aspects of our literate spaces with 
signi˜cant consequences, we advocate in this working paper for conscious attention to improving the G
˛
A
˛
I 
literacy of all agents in the academic enterprise: students, faculty members, programs or departments, and 
institut ions. The practices suggested go beyond mere technical uency to support the development of 
critical orient at ions, creat ive responses, community strategies, and personal approaches to G
˛
A
˛
I.

˛
A
˛
I  Literacy  for Students
Students need pract ical, instrumental strategies for using G
˛
A
˛
I to accomplish speci˜c object ives. They also 
seek to understand how G
˛
A
˛
I may inuence expectations for performance in t heir courses, the quality of 
the education they may receive from instructors who use G
˛
A
˛
I tools, and the job market they will face upon 
graduation. G
˛
A
˛
I  literacy,  however,  should  also  include  the  capacity  to  design  or  critique  tools  (Selber),  to  
reshape the rhetorical situation in which one is writing in order to claim more agency, and to question t he 
ethics and ecacy of using these tools in the ˜rst place.


  
6
In this section, we oer a set of G
˛
A
˛
I literacy outcomes for students, primarily those at the early undergrad
-
uate level. Students need to be prepared to make wise judgments about when to use G
˛
A
˛
I systems and 
when not to use them. With LLMs in particular, all users bene˜t from an understanding of the practices of 
critical reading, writing, research, and thinking as these tool s become more integrated into our everyday 
composing practices. While t he outcomes described here are intended for educators and students to read, 
a succinct 
student handout
 has  been  prepared.
Learning Outcomes for G
˛
A
˛
I  Literacies
College students can learn and demonstrate the following outcomes for making decisions about using G
˛
A
˛
I 
as a tool for writing:
Evaluate  G
˛
A
˛
I  output  for accuracy.
 The accuracy and precision of G
˛
A
˛
I dier according to the version of the 
tool being used. Whereas free versions of these tools may invent information based on a user™s prompt and 
an algorithmic formula, subscription versions often accommodate more user input and have access to more 
data to improve the accuracy of their results. However, price is not necessarily a measure of quality in the 
informat ion-gathering process. When asking G
˛
A
˛
I to p roduce text that asserts facts about reality, students 
need to be sure that the information they receive is correct by checking for ot her sources to verify the 
accuracy  of  the  results.  References  need  to  be checked through  a  library  database,  online search  engine,  
or documentation in the print record.
Evaluate  G
˛
A
˛
I outp ut for relevancy.
 Eective uses of G
˛
A
˛
I and other technologies produce results that match 
the purpose of a reading, writing, or research task. Since chat bots, unless specially p rogrammed to do so, 
do not ask users probing questions that will help generate relevant results, G
˛
A
˛
I will not always p roduce 
results that are useful or relevant for an academic task or learning activity. The value of G
˛
A
˛
I is thus limited 
by the extent to which a human writer can assess whether the output is relevant to the task. For example, 
if a writing task asks for analy sis and the text produced is summary, then the writer must be able to assess 
the  dierences between  these  two  textual  purposes  and  make  choices  about  how  to  adapt,  rev ise,  or  
reprompt  to  generate  app ropriate  material.
Evaluate  G
˛
A
˛
I  output  for bias
. 
The output of G
˛
A
˛
I systems is only as good as the data it has been trained 
on. Because the data used so far tend to reect the knowledge and practices of the majority, G
˛
A
˛
I is likely 
to produce output t hat reects the most commonly used and standardized practices. This is the case with 
language use, where it has been noted that the patterns of language use in AI-generated texts are rather 
normative and unreective of multilingual and multicultural varieties (Rettberg). An import ant part of stu dent 
development is learning to question the kinds of received stereotypes that G
˛
A
˛
I may reproduce.
Understand the role of privacy and data securit y when deciding on G
˛
A
˛
I  use
. 
It is important to understand 
what data we are signing away when choosing to use a G
˛
A
˛
I tool and how this information will be used by 
the companies whose property it has become. It is not always clear to users precisely what data is being 
collected when information is fed into a G
˛
A
˛
I system, and such uses are being continually renegotiated at 
corporate and regulatory levels. Neither is it easy to understand the agreements users enter into in order 
to use a G
˛
A
˛
I product. Students and teachers alike should be aware of the terms they agree to when signing 
up for a G
˛
A
˛
I system and may want to analyze those together in class before unpacking the implications. 


  
7
Consider asking, What data and met adata are the company collecting? What will it do with the data? Are 
those  purposes  ethical?  If  not,  what  opt ions  are  t here?  Who  bene˜ts  and  who  loses  when  the  input  or  
output of G
˛
A
˛
I  is  commercialized?
Adapt to di˜erent G
˛
A
˛
I tools as technolo gy changes over time.
 G
˛
A
˛
I  and  other  technologies  change  rapidly.  
Each new iteration of G
˛
A
˛
I tools will produce more robust, more responsive, and ﬁsmarterﬂ responses and 
also may have dierent ﬁguardrailsﬂ that prohibit harmful or dangerous information. College students need 
to develop the exibility to make choices about using dierent technologies as tools for reading and writing 
instead of focusing only on how to use a particular tool for a particular task. Expect that t he practical and 
ethical choices t hat students need to make about technologies and t he skills t hey need to use will evolve 
as  new technologies  em erge.
Analyze the rhetorical situation of a writing task and determine the appropriate uses of G
˛
A
˛
I for that task 
(if  any).
 Eect ive choices about writing depend on the situat ion, including the writer™s purpose, audience, 
and genre, and writers need to develop t he ability to match uses of G
˛
A
˛
I and other technologies with each 
new writing situation. G
˛
A
˛
I-literate  users  will  be  familiar  with  the  multiple  purposes  for  which  they  might  use  
G
˛
A
˛
IŠfor help with brainstorming, creating an outline, summarizing an unfamiliar source, forging a deeper 
unders tanding of a topic through question-and-answer exchange, editing, or citat ion creation, among other 
tasksŠwhereas new users may not recognize the applications or the limitations of such tool s immediately. 
Developing G
˛
A
˛
I literacy means being able to break down a writing, reading, and research task into clear, 
manageable steps and assessing at each phase what G
˛
A
˛
I has to oer for t hat point in the process.
Exp lain the reasons for informed choices about using or not using G
˛
A
˛
I for critical reading, writing, 
research,  and  learning  processes.
 U nderstanding how G
˛
A
˛
I might be used as part of the writing p rocess 
is part of technological pro˜ciency. As important, however, is a writer™s ability to explain why they chose to 
use  G
˛
A
˛
I for particular processes. MetacognitionŠt hinking abou t thinkingŠ is a core part of literacy; expert 
writers and expert G
˛
A
˛
I users can articulate the rationale for their choices, including how the use of G
˛
A
˛
I 
helped contribute to the ˜nal product.
Accurate ly represent the use of G
˛
A
˛
I
 
in research and writing processes through attribution or meta
-
commentary.
 All writers using G
˛
A
˛
I to generate text or to sup port their work as writers and researchers 
need to be transparent about their use. Depending on the context, this transparency might inclu de a 
footnote explaining the use, an author™s note or memo, an introductory acknowledgement, in-text citations 
that follow a recognized documentation style and the recommended format provided in that system of 
citation, or an appendix or link with the full record of prompts and outputs. G
˛
A
˛
I text submitted for a graded 
assignment or course credit, for professional purposes (such as scholarship applications), or for admissions 
essays must follow the standards laid out by the reviewing entity. Writers who are G
˛
A
˛
I-literate  will always  err  
on  the side  of  transparency.
Access  and  understand  p olicies  and  guide lines  for  using  G
˛
A
˛
I set by an instructor or institution.
 Permi s
-
sible and successful uses of G
˛
A
˛
I are determined by institut ional policy and by the instructor, course, ˜eld  
of study, purpose of assignments, and requirements for dierent learning act ivities. Students need to know  
how  to  locate  resources  at  their  school  that  describe  their  rights  and  responsibilities  when  using  G
˛
A
˛
I for  
coursework.  They  also  need  to  recognize  that  these  guidelines  might  change  over  tim e  and  might  be  shaped

by national or international regulations about privacy, intellectual property, or other concerns. Students who  
have an accommodation plan for a disability may have ot her rights connected to using G
˛
A
˛
I  as  an  assis tive  
technology tool. For each course, students need to ˜nd relevant guidelines in the syllabus, orient ation unit, or  
online  resources  to  help  determine  when  and  how  they  might  use  (or  cannot  use)  G
˛
A
˛
I tools.
Monitor G
˛
A
˛
I use in re lation to their learning goals, inclu ding reco gnizing when an overre liance on G
˛
A
˛
I 
tools prevents learning.
 Any technology used as a tool for learning can shape how and what a student 
learns. Students need to develop an awareness of how their uses of G
˛
A
˛
I inuence and change their learn
-
ing  p rocesses  and  experiences.  Whet her  students  choose  to  use  G
˛
A
˛
I or are required to do so, t hey need 
to monitor when and how it helps them learn. Monitoring G
˛
A
˛
I use for learning means that students pay 
attention to situations where using G
˛
A
˛
I makes learning dicult, keeps them from achieving the goals of a 
course, or prevents them from developing skills needed for future learning .

Writers need to learn how to adapt their writing to diverse situations that involve au diences of human

A

I , they need to critically reect on how its 
use aects their abilities to develop skills, strategies, and processes that help them achieve t heir writ ing 
goals and their assumptions about human trust and understanding . They need to be able to identify when

Pedago gical  Considerations
Ł
 
How, if at all, will G

I  enhance  the  l earning  experience  for  stu dents?
Ł
 
What is the distinction between using G

E thical  Considerations
Ł
 
Who owns the intellectual property rights to content generated within an A I exchange?
Ł
 
What hap pens to the work (their own and ot hers™ texts, assignments, etc.) that users share with the

Ł
 
What information are users ex plicitly and tacitly sharing with the companies who own t he G

I?
Ł
 
How can educators protect their own and t heir students™ privacy?
Ł
 
When is it appropriate for creators to use content generated within a G

they acknowledge the use of G
˛
A
˛
I , especially in a situation of content drift, where the G
˛
A
˛
I outpu t 
cannot  be  duplicated  in  a  new  search?
These considerations are by no means exhaus tive but begin to suggest the comp lexities educators face in 
using or experimenting with G

A
˛
I.
Developing  G
˛
A
˛
I Literacy for Educators
The  landscape  of  G
˛
A
˛
I technologies and programs is rapidly evolving . We encourage educators to actively 
engage with the technologies in order to have an informed understanding of how they work and how their 
students might be using them.
Exp erience and exp eriment with these technolo gies.
 With the increasing implementation of G
˛
A
˛
I  tech
-
nologies into widely used systems (such as word processors, operating systems, and search engines), it 
becomes harder to opt out of considering the impact of these technologies. Ignoring G
˛
A
˛
I is not a sustain
-
able position, because without guidance, students may use G
˛
A
˛
I uncritically in their writing . We recommend 
that  educators  familiarize  themselves  with  G
˛
A
˛
I tools and consider when students might bene˜t from them 
and when they would not. Beyond familiarity, we encourage educators to play with the tool s in order to 
unders tand their capacity for language, invention, and narrative.


  
10
Seek out professional deve lopment.
 While institutions and departments should p rovide avenues for 
professional develop ment in G
˛
A
˛
I literacy, educators may need to participate in, create, and locate alterna
-
tive sources. Options might include joining the many active discussions of G
˛
A
˛
I in education on social media, 
establishing professional learning communit ies of educators on focused topic s, or seeking out reading 
circles and discussion groups that support instructors in this work.
2
Read current articles and p opular non˚ction about AI as we ll as emerging Critical Arti˚cial Inte lligence 
Literacy  (CAIL)  scholarship.  
Readings wit h dense technological jargon may appear intimidating, but not 
keeping current with relevant scholarly literature may aect job performance or professional ad vancement 
and hinder participation in dialogues about changing pedagogical practices. Fortunately, many authors 
have published CA IL scholarship written for a broad readership (Brossard et al.; Buolamwini; Crawford). 
Continuing research will allow educators to consider how t he evolution of G
˛
A
˛
I  necessit ates  changes  in 
the work we assign and how we scaold instruction as well as how tu tors consult with learners on their 
projects.
In many cases, we will need to supplement our current disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge through 
interacting with G
˛
A
˛
I or in conversations with internal and external experts in the ˜eld. Through continued 
research,  instructors  can  educate  themselves  about  how interactions  with  G
˛
A
˛
I aect not only what is taught 
and how it is taught (or tutored) but also our capacities to imagine potential areas for resistance and other 
forms of critical action in related spheres, including types of literacies, de˜nitions of authorship, research 
agendas  and  the  research  process  itself,  employm ent  p rospects  (our  own  and  those of  our  students),  and 
larger political, economic, and labor frameworks for these technologies.
Foreground  an  ethic  of  transparency.
 It is important for instructors who incorporate G
˛
A
˛
I into their own 
composing practices to model t he ethic of transparency that they would want students to emulate. For 
example, if A I is used to schedule meetings, summarize video calls, or create visual illustrations, it is import
-
ant to discuss this with students. (However, we and others [see Furze; Warner] would caution against using 
LLMs to assess student writing or to write tailored feedback to students, given the danger of undermining 
trust and human connection in the classroom.) Appropriately acknowledging the use of these assistive tech
-
nologies encourages students to disclose their own patterns of use. For example, it is important to discuss 
the diculties of ﬁcitingﬂ output from LLMs that are drawn from enormous databases of fragments derived 
from heterogeneous sources. Encouraging stu dents to share as much material from the writing proces s as 
is practically feasibleŠ including prompts, outputs, and draftsŠwill assist with building an environment of 
transparency  and  mutual  respect.
Situate contemporary AI u se within a larger historical and cultural context of teaching with technolo gy. 
Educators must help students frame G

A
˛
I  literacy  within  their existing  literacies.  These  technologies  are  
new, but the emot ional, intellectual, and creative skills needed to ethically and successfully navigate these 
changes  are  not.
Acknowledge how linguistic and social biases can be exacerbated by G

A

. Educators must examine their 
own implicit biases and assumptions about the relationship between language and identity, taking care to 
avoid making negative assumpt ions about marginalized writers on the basis of their academic writing . They 
must also be aware that G

A
˛
I outpu t is suspected of inherent cultural bias.


  
11
Literature across a number of disciplines has shown that international students and multilingual students 
who are writing in English are more likely than native English speakers to be accused of G
˛
A
˛
I-related  aca
-
demic misconduct  (Parthner;  Tzanni;  Foltynek  et  al.;  Liang et  al.;  Weber-Wul et  al.). The  probl em  is  twofold. 
Studies have shown t hat G
˛
A
˛
I detectors are more likely to ag English prose written by non-native speakers 
as A I-generated (Liang et al.; Weber-Wult al.), but even instructors who do not use A I detectors should 
be aware that suspicions of misuse of G
˛
A
˛
I are often related to a comp lex of factors, including culture, 
context,  and  unconscious  ﬁnative-speakerism,ﬂ  rather  than  actual  misconduct  (Parthner;  Tzanni).
A˛rm the imp ortance of shared governance and academic freedom in creating guide lines and p olicy 
around academic uses of G
˛
A
˛
I. 
The American Association of University Professors states that academic 
freedom  includes  ﬁthe  right  of  the  faculty  to  select  the  materials,  determine  the  ap proach  to  the  subject,  
make the assignments, and assess s tudent academic performance in teaching act ivities for which faculty 
members are individually responsibleﬂ (ﬁFAQsﬂ). For instructors who face growing pressure to include these 
technologies in their classrooms, disciplinary expertise and decision-making through shared governance 
are essential in determining what approach is appropriate for their students and curricula. We encourage 
colleagues to engage in those conversations when called upon in the interest of arriv ing at shared disci
-
plinary or governance unit stances that are both exible and equitable.
Respect  the choice  to  opt out.
 One potent ial outcome of CA IL might be an instructor™s informed decision  
not to engage with or permit A I technologies in particular assignments, activities, or courses. Instructors  
need to consider that deciding to opt out means that the burden of teaching students to use these technolo
-
gies responsibly is shifted to other classes and instructors, including those in more precarious positions who  
may not enjoy the same degree of academic freedom. Some instructors may face consequences in hiring  
and evaluation processes when they opt out of teaching A I literacies in their classrooms, part icularly when  
shared  governance  processes  have  determined  departm ent-wide  uses  for  A I  in  the  curriculum.
Protect student privacy. 
Many LLMs require users to share personal information in order to access their 
platforms for composing . It is important to allow students to opt out of these forms of disclosure. Institutions 
may also use A I to monitor stu dent writing, which may raise many privacy concerns (Han et al.).
Additional  Considerations  for  Instructors
Those who design curricula, assign work, and evaluate s tudents™ learning have speci˜c responsibilities 
when it comes to G
˛
A
˛
I literacy. In designing assignments or projects wit h G
˛
A
˛
I in mind, we must ˜rst ask 
what educational purpose G
˛
A
˛
I has in our assignments or projects. We must also ask how much labor we 
are willing to put into designing or redesigning assignments and projects with G
˛
A
˛
I in mind. Both questions 
require careful consideration. Most importantly, faculty members who evaluate student work must use great 
care in incorporating A I technologies into the feedback and grading process.
Below are key considerations for incorporat ing G
˛
A
˛
I literacy into syllabi and classroom policy:
Ł
 
G
˛
A
˛
I literacy should be considered vital to the teaching of research, writing, language, and literature  
across  a  variety  of  course  topic s  and  departmental  curricula.  The  importance of  such literacy  should  
be reected in course learning objectives t hat are the grounds for assessment rat her than in t he mere  
addition of new academic honesty verbiage or the super ˜cial retooling of individual assignments.


  
12
Ł
 
Educators should carefully consider issues of power and privilege through the discussion of access 
and linguistic diversity so their G
˛
A
˛
I  policies  will empower rather  than  harm  stu dents.
Ł
 
Educators should be transparent in their incorporation of G
˛
A
˛
I literacy into their syllabi, assignments, 
writing  projects,  research,  and  assessm ent.
Ł
 
Classroom policies on G
˛
A
˛
I  should  align  with  institutional  policies  where  those  exis t.
Ł
 
Educators may want to think about developing teaching approaches that enable students and teachers  
to reect on and discuss t he role of G
˛
A
˛
I in their writing process, project stages, or research strategies.
Ł
 
Making classroom and institutional policies available for students™ reference is not sucient to 
promote G
˛
A
˛
I literacy; scaolding must occur in class.
Graduate  Student  Instructors
Graduate teaching assistants (college instructors who while enrolled in a graduate degree program have 
full or partial responsibility for instruction of undergraduate courses, sections, or labs) can ˜nd themselves 
in a liminal position regarding policy and literacy development. The ways they are learning to use and 
integrate  G
˛
A
˛
I tools into their own research and writing may dier from those they might wish to apply in 
instruction or materials creation in classes they are responsible for. And, since many graduate teaching 
assistants are pursuing graduate degrees directly or shortly after their undergraduate education, t here may 
be assumptions about their knowled ge and pro˜ciency wit h these tools. Consider graduate students™ dual 
roles as both teachers and students when creating resources or policies that aect G

A
˛
I use in classrooms.
III. G
˛
A
˛
I  Li teracy for  Programs  and  Depar tments
The  impact  that G
˛
A
˛
I is having on writing studies and the humanities, as well as other disciplines, cannot be 
overst ated. In this section, we spell out key issues, questions, and responsibilities facing academic units 
broadly as well as coordinators, administrators, or chairs of academic units. We identify common issues as 
well as local contexts that inuence the creation of a culture within a program to develop G
˛
A
˛
I  literacy.
We address here those programs with responsibility for various types of language, literature, communication,  
and writing- intensive ˜elds of study. These might include any of the following:
Ł
 
corequisite support for composition courses
Ł
 
creative  writing
Ł
 
developmental reading and writing
Ł
 
English programs and degrees
Ł
 
˜rst-year writing
Ł
 
general education writing and writing-
intensive courses beyond ˜rst-year writing
Ł
 
graduate programs in English s tudies and 
related  ˜elds
Ł
 
integrated reading and writing
Ł
 
technical and professional writ ing
Ł
 
TESOL and ESL programs
Ł
 
writing  across  the  curriculum
Ł
 
writing centers
Ł
 
writing minors or majors


  
13
For such programs, coordination and administration responsibilities can be distribu ted in a variety of way s. 
We address here t he multiple con˜gurations in which this labor may take place. Many programs have a 
dedicated coordinator position, faculty overload work, reassigned time, or shared governance structures 
like working groups or committees (see Calhoon-Dillahunt). In any of these structures, program develop
-
ment work must address common teaching and learning needs in relation to G
˛
A
˛
I.
Program  coordinators  should  start  thinking about  G
˛
A
˛
I literacies in their local contexts by developing student 
learning outcomes related to G
˛
A
˛
I literacies such as those provided in section I. Rat her than add new 
outcomes, it is recommended to fold G
˛
A
˛
I literacies into existing outcomes. The purpose of this approach is 
threefold: to reduce the labor associated with adding to what may be an already long list of outcomes; to 
avoid the ﬁadd-onﬂ approach that minimizes the role and purpose of digital technologies, including G
˛
A
˛
I , in 
the curriculum and instruction; and to incorporate G
˛
A
˛
I literacies into the work instructors already do in their 
classrooms. Hence, program coordinators should deconstruct the exist ing student learning outcomes of 
their program  to  identify  the  places  where  G
˛
A
˛
I literacy outcomes may be incorporated.
The following list includes much of the learning expected to happen at our p rograms, and program coordi
-
nators should expand t his list depending on t he goal s of their respective programs:
Ł
 
foundational knowledge and understanding of G

A

Ł
 
knowledge of the aordances, limitations, harms, and opportunities of G

Taking a Pro gram-Level Approach to G
˛
A
˛
I  Literacy
Though there is much variety in what individual educators can do to support G
˛
A
˛
I  literacy  in their  courses,  
we recommend thinking about G
˛
A
˛
I literacy at the program level as well in order to support instructors as 
they develop their knowledge and skills.
Buil d on existing practices. 
Programs need to adapt G
˛
A
˛
I  curricula  and  teaching  resources  to  the  varied  
purposes and outcomes of a range of courses. For example, English departments may oer reading, writ
-
ing,  literature,  cultural  studies,  and  other  ty pes  of  courses.  Approaches  to  developing  curricula  and  teaching 
support for G
˛
A
˛
I literacy need to build on existing eective teaching practices that reect the purposes of 
each course, the literacy strategies s tudents need to successfully complete each course and program, and 


  
14
the unique features of each English studies sub˜eld. Similarly, language departments that house instruction 
for multiple languages must consider the linguistic and cultural approaches to teaching that support eec
-
tive curriculum and instruction for a particular language.
Design  courses strategically.  
Course design  strategies  can embed  G
˛
A
˛
I literacy across a program in a way 
that supports students™ literacy development as they t ransition to new courses, grow as college learners, 
and work toward completing a degree. An eective G
˛
A
˛
I curriculum supports students™ development 
throughout a program, from basic language and literacy courses to upper-division coursework. Programs 
need to consider t he G
˛
A
˛
I literacy skill s and strategies required for navigating the ˜nal course in a program 
and  then  work  backward  toward earlier  courses  to  determine basic  G
˛
A
˛
I literacy skill s that lead to more 
complex critical engagement with G
˛
A
˛
I  in  sub sequent  courses.
A comprehensive approach to embedding G
˛
A
˛
I literacy (and other forms of literacy instruction) through
-
out a program considers both overall program goals and outcomes and the learning outcomes for individual 
courses.  For  example:
Ł
 
Developmental writing, reading, and integrated reading and writing courses can teach basic skills 
and strategies that provide a foundation for understanding G
˛
A
˛
I and its uses and for learning more 
complex skills and strategies as students p ractice reading, writ ing, and learning in ot her disciplines.
Ł
 
First-year courses can introduce students to G
˛
A
˛
I literacies that they later build on for reading, 
writing, and learning in major courses.
Ł
 
Beginning language courses can introduce students to strategies for using G
˛
A
˛
I eectively and 
ethically as a language learning tool to support later learning, including the development of critical 
approaches  to  G
˛
A
˛
I ,  in interm ediate  and  advanced  courses.
Rather than  focusing  on  particular  technologies,  program-l evel  course  design  strategies  should  focus  on  
helping students develop skills and strategies that they can adapt as G
˛
A
˛
I technologies change over t ime.
Start with ˚rst-year writing. 
An  almost  universal  graduation  requirem ent,  ˜rst-year  writing  courses  are  
intended to provide students with literacy skills and s trategies they will draw from throughout their college 
careers. For this reason, such courses have a special responsibility to teach students how to use G
˛
A
˛
I 
critically and eectively in academic situations and across their literate lives. First-year writing courses 
taught t hrough concurrent enrollment and dual credit models, many of which are taught in secondary 
settings  by  high  school  teachers,  share this  mandate.  As  policy  approaches  may  dier  between  high  school  
and college contexts, it will be especially important to ensure conversat ions are t aking place between sites 
of to ensure consistent quality of learning for college writers.
Assess needs of ESL pro grams. 
At inst itutions that oer both ESL and second language writing courses, 
program coordination work connected to G
˛
A
˛
I  needs  to  address curricular  dierences  between  the  two 
programs. When students can self-select either program, and when writing programs enroll students who 
have p reviously completed ESL coursework, writing and ESL programs can collaborate on ap proaches to 
embedding  G
˛
A
˛
I literacies into the curriculum to support students™ transitions to the writing program and 
other credit-bearing coursework. TESOL faculty members and second language writing specialists can help 
inform the writing program about how students use G
˛
A
˛
I for language learning .


  
15
Academic support units merit additional special considerations. Individual educators and program leaders 
who work with students outside the traditional teacher-stu dent relat ionship have unique opportunities to 
foster deep learning . While many learning professionals and tutors see themselves as uniquely posit ioned 
to address G
˛
A
˛
I literacy with writers and language learners, we must acknowledge that tutors do their work 
within the parameters of others™ expectations. We t herefore recommend taking the following steps before 
discussing  G
˛
A
˛
I with clients or employing A I tools within the tutoring environment:
1.
 
Determine  whether  the  institution, the  departm ent,  or  the  individual  faculty  m ember  who  created  the  
assignment  has  a  policy  regarding  whether,  how,  and  when  G
˛
A
˛
I may be used.
2.
 
If a clear and coherent policy exists, t ailor your practice and the professional development of your 
tutors to it. If you disagree with the policy, advocate for a change to the degree that you can. Many 
campuses have created an A I task force; make the case that the writing or learning center should be 
on it. If support organizations are represented in the conversat ion, they can remind others that G
˛
A
˛
I is 
not  a  replacement  for  a  human  audience.
3.
 
If a policy does not yet exis t or policies across campus are contradictoryŠa situation that is all too 
common, according to an empirical study conducted by Chiu and colleagues in late 2023Šthen try 
th e  following:
Ł
 
Seek leadership. Help your campus colleagues understand that academic integrity policies 
that were designed before G
˛
A
˛
I are insucient to address the complexities of these new 
technologies in relation to academic integrity. Encourage them to work toward coordinated 
G
˛
A
˛
I policy across campus rather than leaving policymaking to individual educators. This is 
a great opportunity to make your services visible, to exercise leadership, and to frame the 
conversation in a way that protects rather than harms students.
Ł
 
Start with your unit. After seeking input from relevant stakeholders at your institu tion and 
consulting best practices, develop a visible policy clarifying the degree to which G
˛
A
˛
I is 
used in your context. In addition to serving as a model for your campus, this step could help 
forestall criticism of your tutoring practices as inconsistent with academic integrity.
Ł
 
Provide professional development on G
˛
A
˛
I for your tutors. Tutors not only need to understand 
the is sues raised in this paper but also need to know how to discuss the use of G
˛
A
˛
I and 
facilitate it for assignments and purposes that are not t heir own. In other words, their t raining 
needs to be speci˜c to their roles as outside experts and mediators.
4.
 
Whether or not your campus has a policy regarding G
˛
A
˛
I , we recommend that you assure learners, 
tutors, faculty members, and administrators t hat the role of academic support services does not 
include surveillance of and reporting on learners™ G
˛
A
˛
I  use.


  
16
Developing  Curricula  and  Instructional  Resources
G
˛
A
˛
I literacy should be embedded into the curriculum of an entire course instead of oered as a stand-
alone lesson or unit. Program coordinators and faculty leaders might support inst ructors in embedding G
˛
A
˛
I 
literacy  into  a course  through  som e  of  the  foll owing  approaches:
Ł
 
Create a model course schedule that shows instructors how to introduce G
˛
A
˛
I concepts and then 
build on them in recursive ways in subsequent parts of a course.
Ł
 
Develop examples of classroom and online activities that demonstrate how to incorporate G
˛
A
˛
I 
literacy  into  existing  course  activities.
Ł
 
Sugges t breaking model writing projects into manageable process steps for stu dents with ideas for 
incorporating critical G
˛
A
˛
I literacy into the process at each stage.
Ł
 
Provide examples of language about G
˛
A
˛
I literacy for the course sy llabus to show its connection to 
course  learning outcom es.
Ł
 
Sugges t  activities  that  help  students  learn  through  experience  where  G
˛
A
˛
I is useful, appropriate, or 
ethical to draw from.
Ł
 
Sugges t reective activities that engage students in connecting G
˛
A
˛
I literacies to t heir learning in 
current  and  future  courses  and  in  a  f uture  career.
Ł
 
Discus s modeling stu dent agency to not use G
˛
A
˛
I.
Programs should develop model curricula and teaching resources for incorporating critical G
˛
A
˛
I  literacies  
into  individual  courses  and  across  a  program.  A  program-level  approach  creates  consistency  across  course  
sections, reduces course preparation workload for part-time and contingent faculty members, and creates 
resources that instructors can build on for developing their own teaching materials. Examples of model 
curricula include course development shells, a shared drive or folders with sample materials, and peer 
mentoring and support relationships.
In order to achieve those learning outcomes and to ensure coherent teaching of the revised curriculum, 
program coordinators should argue for building faculty development opportunities for instructors in their 
programs. These op portunities should be ongoing to allow for deep and meaningful engagement with the 
topic s presented and the emergence of generative discussions. In other words, the one-shot workshop 
model will not support the intended outcomes. We make the following recommendations in relation to 
facult y develop m ent:
Ł
 
Faculty development meetings should be a space for building inst ructors™ conceptual knowledge 
about  G
˛
A
˛
I literacies, helping them develop t heory- informed pedagogical practices for integrating 
G
˛
A
˛
I into their teaching, and allowing them to experiment with G
˛
A
˛
I technologies and develop their 
technological  skills.
Ł
 
Such  gatherings can  simult aneously  address  instructors™  resist ance,  fear,  and  hesit at ion  about  
using G
˛
A
˛
I in t heir teaching while also recognizing that faculty development programs cannot make 
instructors experts in G
˛
A
˛
I , which is not an attainable goal given the fast-changing nature of these 
technologies.


  
17
Ł
 
Continue to build on instructors™ current teaching knowledge and p ractices in the course of working 
from conceptual knowledge to pedagogical and instructional practices that instructors may transfer 
to their classrooms. Instructors are likely to integrate G
˛
A
˛
I in t heir teaching when they see it as 
related to what they already know and do.
Ł
 
Coordinators can look for opportunities to collaborate with other units at their institutions that may 
provide logistical, technical, or administrative sup port for their faculty development endeavors. U nits 
such as libraries and centers for teaching and learning may be willing to contribute resources (such 
as space, time, and scheduling) in exchange for support of their mission and programming (which 
coordinators might provide by putting toget her a panel on G
˛
A
˛
I  literacies  at their  facility,  for  example).
We adv ise that program coordinators position themselves, their p rograms, and their administrative work 
as part of the bigger-picture work happening at their institu tion, emphasizing the ways in which their work 
contributes to student learning and preparing G

A

I  Literacy  for  Institutions
Institutions, from executive-level administrators to staembers with decision-making responsibilit ies 
across a campus or sy stem, are grappling with the changes that G
˛
A
˛
I is ushering in. Prioritizing G
˛
A
˛
I  literacy  
is consistent with t he research missions of all institu tions of higher education, because these sites of collec
-
tive knowledge-making must continue to promote transparency, informed consent, and harm reduction in 
the  research  p rocess.
In this section, we sketch out what G
˛
A
˛
I literacy at an institutional level looks like.
Citizenship,  E thics,  and  Integrity  as  Institutions
One of the most important responsibilities of colleges and universities is to foster a culture of ethic s and 
integrity that serves as a model for students as they not only become trained for a profession but also 
develop as global citizens. Discussions of et hic s and integrity as related to AI technologies should not 
be focused exclusively on caveats to students about using G
˛
A
˛
I for the purpose of academic dishonesty. 
Rather, while educating the students who will eventually be re˜ning A I technologies and creating new 
ones, institutions that foreground t he crucial role of humanities disciplines, such as language and literature, 
rhetoric and composition, technical and p rofessional communication, philosophy and ethic s, his tory, and 
cultural  studies,  not  only  increase  t he  career  readines s of  their  STEM  students  but  also  help  shape  their  
unders tanding of why ethic s and integrity in the conceptual and developmental phases of t hese technolo
-
gies are so important to the future of humanity and democracy.
AI  Literacy  and  Research
When institutions provide funding and support for A I research, they should also recognize t hat this research 
occurs in many p laces across campus, including in writing programs, libraries, and language depart ments. 
In other words, A I research is not the sole domain of STEM ˜elds. An unsiloed ﬁA I across t he curriculumﬂ 


  
18
approach to A I literacy that includes students as researchers does not assume that this literacy is remedial, 
self -evident,  or  unrelated  to  other  discourses  of power.
It is also important not to assume that A I research only occurs in high-prestige Research 1 institutions. 
Researchers at access-oriented institutions with closer and more reciprocal relationships with people from 
marginalized groups, in precarious economic positions, and at risk of incarceration and deportation provide 
valuabl e  perspectives  on  t hese  technologies.
Because research partnerships often involve transnat ional or corporate ties, it is also important to recognize 
that A I technologies are being used for surveillance, disinformat ion, censorship, and pro˜ ling around t he 
globe in ways that are inconsistent with t he democrat ic values of higher education. For example, in 2018 
a  posit ive  headline  declared,  ﬁMIT  and  SenseTime  Announce eort  to Advance  Arti˜cial  Intelligence  
Research.ﬂ  The  following  year,  
The New York Times
 ran  stories  about how  SenseTim e  had  enabled  perse
-
cution of ethnic Muslims in China using AI (Mozur).
When investing in educational technologies (ﬁed techﬂ) to support students™ scholarly and professional 
development, seek ways to build on lessons learned from past initiat ives in information literacy and digital 
literacy  that  are  grounded in  the  literature of  peer-reviewed  research.  Administrators  should  be  cautious  
about  investing  deeply  in  unproven  technologies  that  might promise  results  without  evidence  and  al so  lack  
the agility to respond to rapid development and obsolescence patterns.
Diversity,  Equity,  and Inclusion
Many cutting-edge technologiesŠ including speech to text, text to speech, and video captioningŠbegan 
as assistive technologies for people with disabilities and have found wide applicat ion beyond t hose 
communities.  A I may  accelerate  these  serv ices  to  students,  faculty  m embers,  and  st  members  who  often  
experience  wait  tim es  for  accessible  course  materials.  Research  centers  such  as  the  
Maryland Initiative 
for  Digital  Accessibility
 can be sources of information on balancing t he bene˜ts of these technologies with 
privacy protect ions for students.
A I-enhanced  technologies  are  also  being  employed  to  increase  ˜rst-generation  and  minoritized  students™  
sense of belonging and retention. The National Institute for Student Success at Georgia State U niversity 
recently received a $7.6 million Department of Education grant ﬁto study how chatbots can improve student 
outcomes in foundational college math and English coursesﬂ (ﬁNational Instituteﬂ). At the same time, it is 
vitally important that issues of consent and student data p rotection be considered in the adopt ion of such 
technologies.
Hiring,  Admissions,  and  Other  Decision-Making  Processes
A I is increasingly used for decision-making in high-stakes situat ions such as hiring (from writing job ads 
to screening and ranking app lications) and immigration (from processing applications to border security). 
When considering the use of AI technologies for decision-making of any kind, institutions need to keep 
foremost in mind t he great potential for algorithmic bias that the popular media often neglects or down
-
plays, such as in a recent article in 
Forbes
 about the use of A I in hiring and ˜ring (Kelly).


  
19
Given the highly p roblematic nature of using algorithms to determine people™s livelihoods and futures, 
we suggest t hat inst itutions exercise ext reme caution in implementing A I technologies in an attempt to 
make hiring, student admis sions, and other applicat ion rev iew p rocesses more ecient and cost-eective. 
Researchers are developing tools t hat may reduce algorithmic bias in college admis sions processes (Neda 
et al.), but close human oversight will continue to be needed to ensure hiring and admissions select ions 
that result in a diverse s tudent body, faculty, and sta.
AI  Literacy  and  Career  Readiness
A I literacy will obviously be important in preparing graduates for the job market, creating t he jobs of the 
future, and retraining in job sectors eliminated by automation, including his torically designated white-collar 
professions, such as t he law and computer programming . A I literacy will also be important in the creative 
industries that produce music, ˜ lm, books, and video games as society begins to grapple wit h dicult 
questions around credit and compensation for G
˛
A
˛
I content synthesized from multiple sources. We urge 
readers with institutional-level inuence and responsibilities to take the following steps:
Ł
 
Recognize  dierences  between  as-yet-unrealized  arti˜cial  general  intelligence  (AGI)  and  current  
applications of machine learning and statist ical modeling while acknowledging the contribu tions 
of training in literary and ˜lm criticismŠparticularly in science ˜ct ion and other forms of speculative 
˜ctionŠto understanding how popular attitudes about A I have already been shaped by the ways 
these technologies  have  been  imagined.
Ł
 
Account for the fact that AI literacy involves speaking, writ ing, reading, and research across 
mult iple media forms, texts, and languages. Although automated translation for ut ilitarian purposes 
might  seem su cient  for  many  career  applications,  the  deeper  cultural knowledge  connected 
to language acquisit ion oered by language depart ments continues to be important for global 
careers  that  require  cultural sensit ivity,  awareness  of  social  relationships,  and  understanding  of 
sha red  histories.
Ł
 
Include training in composing that focuses on process as well as product, given how G
˛
A
˛
I may be 
used dierently in contexts for planning, conceptualizing, organizing, revising, providing feedback, 
and summarizing the work of ot hers. Attent ion to process in A I literacy is particularly important for 
careers that require collaboration, project management, problem-solving, iterative design, and 
learning and reection.
Community  Engagement
Institutions engaging in research and development of A I technologies that are intended to bene˜t the 
public should work directly with the relevant communities to ensure that they are ˜ lling an actual need 
or addressing an existing challenge rather than inadvertently creating new problems for those commu
-
nities. More generally speaking, the potential unintended negative consequences of all A I research on 
communities  should  also  be  carefully  considered  and  periodically  reevaluated  t hroughout  the  research  
and development p rocess. The authors of 
A Call for Universities to Develop Requirements for Community 
Engagement in AI Research
 note that ﬁworking only wit h data instead of people means that A I researchers 


  
20
have t he ability to develop systems that change hundreds of lives or impact culture without ever involving 
anyone from impacted communities in their researchﬂ (Black et al. 2).
Government  Relations,  Compliance,  Risk Management
At a moment when the legislative and regulatory environment for G
˛
A
˛
I is unsettledŠand t here is active 
litigation  over copyright issues  around  LLMsŠcolleges  and  universities  may  think  about  balancing  risk  
management with the encouragement of experimentation, innovation, and creativity. Administrators will ˜nd 
expertise among scholarly communication and informat ion policy librarians as well as a robust conversation 
among civic tech and civil society organizations engaged in A I-related ad vocacy for privacy, civil liberties, 
and balanced copyright. This kind of expert ise can inform policy around the use of G
˛
A
˛
I in computational 
research, privacy and consent agreements for students and creators, and licensing and procurement 
negotiat ions and decisions with ed tech providers.
In the copyright realm, t he National Endowment for t he Humanities funded t he development of legal 
literacies for text and data mining that can inform discussion around G
˛
A
˛
I (ﬁBuildingﬂ). The Library Copyright 
Alliance has published a set of principles around copyright and AI that endeavor to clarify the dist inction 
between ingesting copyrighted materials to train an LLM under the fair use doctrine and the evaluation of 
A I-generated outpu t that might infringe copyright (ﬁLibrary Copyright Allianceﬂ).
Mo deling  and  E˜ciency  and Pro ductivity
Colleges and universities are accountable to their key stakeholders to run operations with eciency, and 
productivity is a core value of the research and knowledge enterprise. G

A
˛
I technologies oer a range of 
real and imagined solutions for eciency and productiv ity in areas such as records management, admis
-
sions review, measuring faculty and depart mental performance, and predict ive analytic s of success that 
might guide decision-making . Indeed, it has been suggested that employing A I to address routine tasks 
allows humans to redirect their energies toward higher orders of creativity and intellectual pursuit.
The role of humans in evaluating the uses, design, and outputs of A I technologies is critical here. Admin
-
istrators making determinations about A I-enabled products will want to weigh promises of technological 
eciency against other core values of t he institutionŠ including climate resilience and sustainability; shared 
governance; critical thinking; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and basic fairness. Some of these areas were 
well examined in the ﬁ2024 EDU CAUSE A I Landscape Study,ﬂ which focuses on strategic planning, partner
-
ships, and institutional policy development and concludes with reections on the future of higher education 
and A I and some early consensus principles regarding appropriate and inappropriate uses (Robert).
V.  Conclusions  and  Recommendations
A I , machine learning, and algorithms already pervade daily life. As these technologies develop further, 
institut ions of learning must be open to considering how some of them might enhance teaching, research, 
and community engagement activities while also recognizing t he potential of this rapidly proliferating 
technology  to  exacerbate  inequities  in  access  to  technology.

In this document, we have identi˜ed a number of needs in respect to educational institut ions:
Ł
 
the need for campus coordination and resourcing to support emerging A I technologies
Ł
 
the need for a commonly understood, if evolving, de˜nition of G
˛
A
˛
I literacy and widespread 
education about what the dierent types of AI technologies are and how they work
Ł
 
the need for awareness in ins titutions and the people within them about their own complicity and 
unwitt ing  participation  in  advancing  neoliberal  aims  throu gh  uncrit ical  acceptance  of  AI  technologies
Ł
 
the need for a culture of integrity and ethic s as well as a critical openness surrounding A I 
technologies  on  our  campuses
Successful, ethical and meaning ful engagement with AI at colleges and universities in both teaching 
and research is a result of collaborative, cross-disciplinary eorts that include students, instructors, sta
members, and community stakeholders working together toward common prosocial and prodemocratic 
goals. Guidelines and policy documents surrounding G
˛
A
˛
I literacy and AI technologies more generally must 
foreground human oversight at every step to help p revent algorithmic bias and discrimination and to ensure 
maximum  accessibility.
A culture of critical A I literacy is meant to be neither for nor against the use of A I; rat her, it involves a 
measured examinat ion and evaluation of its potential advantages for humanity alongside its pitfalls and 
limitations. CA IL informs decisions about when and how
 
to use A I , whether that decision is being made by 
individual students, teachers, programs and departments, or institut ional leaders.
Notes
1 .
 
For the purposes of this working paper, we distinguish between A I literacy, A I literacies, and critical AI 
literacy.  We  use  
AI literacy
 as a s tudent-friendly term encompassing foundational ideasŠnamely, acknowl
-
edging the connections between technologies and communication skills. The term 
A I  l iteracies
 is rooted 
in  communication  disciplines  and  builds on  the  notion  of  multiliteracies  (Selber),  an  understanding  whose  
interconnected and component parts inclu de functional, rhetorical, and crit ical literacies. 
Critical  A I  literacy
 
refers to a set of skills and an orientation that might include skepticism, questioning, situatedness, and an 
awareness  of  power (Bali).
